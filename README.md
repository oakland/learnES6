# learnES6

There are lots of ES6 tutorials online, I pick some of them to practise ES6.

[ES6 standard](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) for full specification of the ECMASript 6 language.
[ES6 In Depth](http://www.hacks.mozilla.org/category/es6-in-depth/) MDN is a very great place to learn ES6.
